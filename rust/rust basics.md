## Why learn rust ❓

- Performance — Rust is used for building high-performance applications, making it valuable for tasks like gaming engines and operating systems.
🔒
- Safety — The language is designed to provide memory safety and prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing.
🔄
- Concurrency — Rust supports concurrent execution, allowing multiple tasks to run in parallel without data races. 🪂
- Versatility — Rust's features make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from low-level system programming to web development.
📈
- Career Growth — Learning Rust can open up opportunities and is a valuable skill in the tech industry.

- Gaming — Rust's performance benefits are particularly useful for developing gaming engines and other performance-critical applications.
🖥️
- Operating Systems — The language is well-suited for building operating systems where performance is a key requirement. 💻
- Web Assembly — Rust is increasingly used for web development, especially in the context of Web Assembly, due to its performance capabilities. 🌐

**🎓 Topics to Learn**

```
- Ownership — In Rust, ownership refers to the concept that only one variable can 'own' a piece of data at a time, and the owner is responsible for deallocating the data when it is no longer needed.
🤝
- Borrowing — Rust allows for the temporary borrowing of data by other variables, either as immutable borrows ('&') for reading or mutable borrows ('&mut') for both reading and writing.
🔄
- Ownership Transfer — Owned data can be transferred to other variables, after which the original owner can no longer access the data. ❗
