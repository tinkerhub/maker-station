## What is  Express.js ❓
Express.js helps you build web applications by providing a set of tools and features that make it easy to handle HTTP requests and responses, create routes, manage middleware, and integrate with databases. It is a web framework application for [**🎨 Node JS**](../../../FrontEnd/).

## Why learn Express.js ❓
First of all, Express.js is easy to learn and use. It is highly flexible and can be used to build a wide range of web applications. Moreover, it is built of top of [**🎨 Node JS**](../../../FrontEnd/) making it more fast and efficient for building web applications.

## 🎓 Skills you can Master
After completing this learning path, you will be knowledgable in:
- Routing and middleware
- Authentication and Authorization
- Working with databases
- Automated testing

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- A solid understanding of [**JavaScript**](../../Languages/JavaScript.md) fundamentals is essential.

- Knowledge of Node.js is essential since Express.js is built on it. You should know how to work with modules, create and run server-side JavaScript code, and interact with the file system.

- Strong knowledge about HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and cookies since HTTP powers the web.

- Basic understanding of the [**CLI**](../../../../Essentials.md) is important. This includes knowing how to navigate directories, create and edit files, and run commands.


## 📲 Installation and Setup

You need a code editor, browser and **Node.js** to follow along this learning path. You can choose the code editor and browser of your choice. The preferred ones are listed below:
- **VS Code**

    Light-weight code editor by Microsoft with a large ecosystem of plugins to help your workflow
    
    [Install VS Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **Google Chrome**
    
    A browser based on V8 JavaScript engine with developer tools.
    
    [Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- **Node.js**

    JavaScript runtime which helps you run JavaScript programs in your system.

    [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

    ***Note:*** Install the stable version
    
    This also installs npm(Node Package Manager) in the system which can be used for installing various dependencies, which are required for the development of the application, including Express.js
    
- **Express.js**

    To install express.js on your device, first you should install node modules into your application. Then install express.js as a separate dependency. The following code can be implemented step-by-step in the terminal.
    
    ```
  > npm install
  > npm install express
    ```
