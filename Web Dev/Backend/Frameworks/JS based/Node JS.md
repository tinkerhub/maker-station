***Note:*** You can use popular libraries like [**Express**](./Express%20JS.md) to create webservers but it is recommended to understand the fundamentals of http before trying out other libraries

**🛠️ Get into action**

A small and easy project to test what you have learned so far:

*Random Name Generator:*  
create webserver that displays a random name from a file named [first-names.txt](https://github.com/dominictarr/random-name/blob/master/first-names.txt), which has each name on a seperate line

## 🚀 Project Pool

Here are few project ideas you can try out, these are just an inspiration to get started. Try to learn and build ideas that come to your mind.

- Real-time chat application: You can build a real-time chat application using Node.js and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

- To Do List: You can build a To Do List application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. This project will involve building an API with Node.js and using a database such as [Mongo DB](../../Databases/MongoDB.md) to store and retrieve tasks.

*Working with external libraries:*  
- [Discord JS](https://discord.js.org/): Create a discord bot that greets a user when they say hello in chat [learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ3tIGHU314&list=PLpmb-7WxPhe0ZVpH9pxT5MtC4heqej8Es).

- [Twitter API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2): Try creating a Twitter bot that tweets on a daily basis indicating the percentage completion of the year corresponding to the date. [check it out](https://twitter.com/year_progress).

*Don't limit yourself to these ideas. Feel free to explore your own and try them out*
