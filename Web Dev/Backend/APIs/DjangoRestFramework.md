## 🎓 Take Away Skills

After completing this learning path you will be knowledgeable in:

- Understanding of what an API is and how it works
- Ability to build a basic CRUD API with Django

  ### Conceptual Knowledge:

- **Serialization:-** Serialization refers to the process of converting complex data structures, such as Python objects, into a format that can be easily transmitted over the network, such as JSON. DRF provides powerful and flexible serialization tools that allow you to easily convert between different data formats.

- **Views:** In DRF, views are Python functions or classes that define the logic for handling incoming requests and generating responses. DRF provides a range of built-in view classes that can handle common tasks, such as CRUD operations and authentication, making it easy to create APIs quickly.

- **Serializers:** Serializers are classes that define how data should be converted to and from a specific data format, such as JSON or XML. DRF provides a range of serializers that make it easy to convert between different data formats and validate incoming data.

- **Authentication:** Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or system before allowing access to protected resources. DRF provides built-in support for several authentication methods, such as token-based authentication and OAuth2, making it easy to secure your APIs.

- **Permissions:** Permissions refer to the rules that govern which users or systems have access to specific resources or actions. DRF provides a range of built-in permission classes that allow you to easily control access to your APIs based on factors such as user roles, IP addresses, or request methods.
